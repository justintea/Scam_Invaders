# Scam_Invaders

## Background🧙🏼‍♂️
The game is a **visual Q&A roleplaying game with a national education spin**. With real-life content and different stories luring people from varied angles, this game aims to bring the player through high-occuring scenarios with scammers, not only to familiarize the player on common tactics, but also help the broader public discern and terminate suspicious outreach. 

I chose to create this game because scams and cybercrimes have a prevalent area of concern in Singapore in recent years, with over $660m in reported losses just in the last 2 years (See analysis below, source: SPF).
I believe a key part of the overall solution to reduce scam volume and financial losses is to educate and ‘immunize’ our population, which I propose can be done through roleplaying scam scenarios and citizens being more discerning of threat agents. 
The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

**Graphs 3 and 4⚔️: Jobs & e-commerce scams are highest in volume, and messaging platforms are the main approach**

## App design & development process🏗
- Define or clarify the why and 'business case' of the app 💵
- Establish 'must-have', 'good-to-have' functionalities, stretch goals (eg. P1, P2-3) 🎖
- Set high-level timeline to achieve must-haves (eg. MVP) 🏹
- An iterative process: Code, mistake, learn (or ask for help), re-code 🌀
- Furnish with better UI/UX (eg. cleaner & more consistent CSS, nicer images) 🎨

## Development timeline🗓
- [x] **Day 0:** High-level roadmapping & prioritization, divergent ideation, draft game architecture, set up server and environment
- [x] **Day 1-2:** Develop MVP 
- [x] **End of Day 2:** Present MVP
- [x] **Day 3:** Develop P2 functionalities, optimize code, fix bugs
- [x] **Day 4:** Develop P3 functionalities, fix bugs, documentation     
- [ ] **Day 5:** Present web app
- [ ] > Always a Day 1👶🏻

## Key Learnings👨🏻‍🎓
- **Time management⏰:** Development time can feel amorphous. It pays to plan deep, break down work items, try quickly.
- **Collaborate🤝:** After spending some time, just go seek help!
- **Some patience needed💆🏻‍♂️:** Addreessing 1 feature can lead to other 'problems'. Really have to develop higher patience, while keeping code tidy.

## Future Improvements🔮
This game is designed and created within the first 2 weeks of my learning of JS, HTML, CSS fundamentals. However, there are still many opportunities to improve the game, which will be worked on in the future, such as:
- loading of question options and messages in the mobile UI (right now is fine, but with more varied questions, this function will help with scalability)
- automatic option-points allocation (right now also manual)
- a better timer option (now it 'saves' the timer of previous questions)
- difficulty settings and a leaderboard, and 
- potentially even the mobile UI to be dynamic for a more enjoyable gaming experience.
