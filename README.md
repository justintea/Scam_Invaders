# Scam_Invaders

**Background**
The game is a visual Q&A roleplaying game with a national education spin. With real-life content and different stories luring people from varied angles, it aims to bring the player through high-occuring scenarios with scammers, not only to familiarize the player on common tactics, but also help the broader public discern and terminate suspicious outreach. 
I chose to create this game because scams and cybercrimes have a prevalent area of concern in Singapore in recent years, with over $660m in reported losses just in the last 2 years (See analysis below, source: SPF).
I believe a key part of the overall solution to reduce scam volume and financial losses is to educate and ‘immunize’ our population, which I propose can be done through roleplaying scam scenarios and citizens being more discerning of threat agents. 
The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

**App design & development process**
- Establish 'must-have' and 'good-to-have' functionalities (eg. P1, P2-3)
- Set high-level timeline to achieve must-haves (eg. MVP)
- An iterative process: Code, mistake, learn (or ask for help), re-code
- Furnish with better UI/UX (eg. cleaner & more consistent CSS, nicer images)

**Future Improvements**
This game is designed and created within the first 2 weeks of my learning of JS, HTML, CSS fundamentals. However, there are still many opportunities to improve the game, which will be worked on in the future, such as:
- loading of question options and messages in the mobile UI (right now is fine, but with more varied questions, this function will help with scalability)
- automatic option-points allocation (right now also manual)
- a better timer option (now it 'saves' the timer of previous questions)
- difficulty settings and a leaderboard, and 
- potentially even the mobile UI to be dynamic for a more enjoyable gaming experience.
